### Gamma Rays
Gamma rays are highly energetic photons of electromagnetic radiation. If they come into contact with the body they can cause cellular mutations, which can lead to cancer.

When handling radioactive material, the user should:
- use tongs, a glove box or robots
- be as far from the source as possible
- minimize exposure time
