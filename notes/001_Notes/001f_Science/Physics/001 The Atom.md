# The Atom


## Isotopes
***Atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.***

The nucleus is held together by the strong nuclear force, the force between two nucleons.

The electrostatic force pushes the nucleus apart (protons repel each other) but the strong nuclear force wins over short distances.

Electrostatic attraction holds the electrons in their energy levels around the nucleus.


Protons repel each other, so the strong nuclear force can only hold a nucleus together when there are enough neutrons in the nucleus to space the protons out.

The numbers of protons and neutrons need to be just right.
Some nuclei are naturally unstable, and break apart, emitting particles and/or energy.
