# Nuclear Equations
[[Science Index|Index]]

Nuclear Equations always show:
- Mass number
- Nuclear charge (atomic number)
- Chemical symbol


### Alpha Decay
- Involves the emission of helium nuclei
$\ce{^238_92U -> ^234_90P + ^4_2He}$


### Beta Decay
- Involves the emission of an electron
$\ce{^16_7N -> ^16_8O + ^0_-1e}$

### Gamma Decay
- Doesn't involve the emission of particles, just energy
$\ce{^22_10Ne^* -> ^22_10Ne + ^0_0\gamma}$

### Fission
- (Splitting of nuclei)



### Fusion
- (Combining of nuclei)
