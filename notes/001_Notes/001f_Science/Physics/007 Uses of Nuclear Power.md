## Chain Reactions
When a uranium-235 nucleus undergoes induced fission after collision with a neutron, it breaks up into two smaller nuclei and two neutrons. These are called fission neutrons.
These fission neutrons can go on to cause further fission events, which will produce further neutrons, and so on, causing a chain reaction.

The smallest amount of mass needed to sustain a chain reaction is called a critical mass.
