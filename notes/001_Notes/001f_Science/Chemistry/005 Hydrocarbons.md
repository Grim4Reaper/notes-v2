# Hydrocarbons
[[001_notes/001f_science/science_index|Index]]


An organic compound is based on carbon atoms, usually contains hydrogen too, and may also contain other non-metal atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen & sulfur. Hydrocarbons are organic compounds.

Carbon has 4 valence electrons, and forms 4 covalent bonds
Hydrogen has 1 valence electrons, and forms 1 covalent bond
Oxygen has 2 valence electrons, and forms 2 covalent bonds
Nitrogen has 3 valence electrons, and forms 3 covalent bonds

Methane has 4 hydrogen and 1 carbon atoms and forms a tetrahedral shape.
Ethane has 6 hydrogen and 2 carbon atoms and forms a tetrahedral shape.

## Formulae and functional groups
The **molecular formula** of a compound shows the number of each type of atom present in one molecule of the compound.

The **empirical formula** of a compound shows the simplest ratio of the atoms present.

Molecular - C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
Empirical - CH<sub>3</sub>,    CH<sub>2</sub>O,       H<sub>2</sub>O

The **structural formula** of a compound shows the arrangement of atoms in a molecule, as well as all the bonds.
It can show the different structures of compounds with the same molecular formulae.

The **condensed formula** of a compound shows how the atoms are arranged in a molecule and, in particular, shows which functional groups are present.
H<sub>2</sub>C=CH<sub>2</sub> - Ethane
CH<sub>3</sub>CHClCH<sub>3</sub> - 2-chloropropane
CH<sub>3</sub>C$\equiv$N - ethanenitrile

The **skeletal formula** of a compound shows the bonds between carbon atoms, but not the atoms themselves. Hydrogen atoms are also omitted, but other atoms are shown - DO NOT USE!

A **functional group** is an atom or group of atoms responsible for the typical chemical reactions of a molecule.

A **homologous series** is a group of molecules with the same functional group but a different number of -CH$_2$ groups.

The **general formula** of a homologous series can be used to calculate the molecular formula of any member of the series by substituting $n$ for the number of carbon atoms.
For example, the general formula of a alkane is C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub> 


## Alkanes
Alkanes contain only single carbon-carbon bonds and so are **saturated**

Number of carbon atoms:
1. CH<sub>4</sub> - Methane
2. C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> - Ethane
3. C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> - Propane
4. C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub> - Butane
5. C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub> - Pentane
6. C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub> - Hexane


Alkanes with four or more carbon atoms display **structural isomerism** because the carbon chain may be either straight or branched.


### Naming
Stems:
1. meth
2. eth
3. prop
4. but
5. pent
6. hex
7. hept
8. oct
9. non
10. dec

Multiple:
2. di
3. tri
4. tetra
5. penta
6. hexa
7. hepta
8. octa
9. nona
10. deca


1. Find the longest chain of carbons - gives the stem
2. Number the carbons along the chain, in such a way that the functional groups & branches receive the lower number possible



## Cycloalkanes
The **cycloalkanes** are a homologous series of hydrocarbons with the general formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub> and names starting in cyclo- and ending **-ane**.

Cycloalkanes have carbon atoms bonded in rings, and contain only single carbon-carbon bonds and so are saturated.

## Alkenes
The **alkenes** are a homologous series of hydrocarbons with the general formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub> and names ending **-ene**.

Alkenes with four or more carbon atoms display **positional isomerism** because the carbon-carbon double bond may appear between different carbon atoms.


## Cycloalkenes
The **cycloalkenes** are a homologous series of hydrocarbons with the general formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n-2</sub> and names starting in cyclo- and ending -ene.
Cycloalkenes have carbon atoms bonded in rings, and contain only at least one carbon-carbon double bond and so are unsaturated

## Alkynes
The **alkynes** are a homologous series of hydrocarbons with the general formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n-2</sub> and names ending -yne.

## Cycloalkynes
Not stable and any atom touching a triple bonded C is a straight line - eg H-C$\equiv$C-H is a straight line


## Isomers
Same molecular formula, different arrangement of atoms.

### Structural
- Atoms bonded in a different order
- Types
	- Chain isomers
		- Have different chains 
		- Eg hexane, 3-methylpentane, 2,3-dimethylbutane (generally [[005 Hydrocarbons#Alkanes|alkanes]])
	- Positional isomers
		- Exist in alkenes with four or more carbon atoms
		- Eg - but-1-yne and but-2-yne
	- Functional group isomers
		- Same atoms and make a different functional group and so are members of different homologous series.
		- Eg - propanol (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O), cyclopentane - 3-methylbut-1-ene



### Stereoisomers
- Atoms bonded in same order but different 3D shape
- (Don't need to know)
- Geometric isomers
	- cis + trans
- Optical isomers
	- mirror images
