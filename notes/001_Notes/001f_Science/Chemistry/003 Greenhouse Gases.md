## The Greenhouse Effect
![[001 The Greenhouse Effect.png|500]]


Q's:
- The carbon dioxide prevented the energy from escaping from the "atmosphere"
	- The sun
	- Planets
	- The atmosphere
- Keeps the planet warm and distributes the solar radiation evenly across the Earth
- The Earth's temperature would increase causing melting of ice caps, extinction of species
- The Earth's atmosphere would keep increasing in temperature which would heat the Earth


## Greenhouse Gases
Greenhouse gases interact with infrared radiation
- Molecules of GHGs absorb IR radiation
- Molecules increase their vibrational energy
- Molecules can re-emit IR radiation, or collide with other substances to pass on kinetic energy

Main GHGs (in order of proportion of warming affect):
- Water vapour, H2O
- Carbon dioxide, CO2
- Methane, CH4
- Dinitrogen monoxide, N2O
- Ozone, O3
- CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons)
- HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons)
