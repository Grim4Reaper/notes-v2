# Enthalpy
The **enthalpy, H**, of a system is a quantitative measure of the potential energy stored in a system. It cannot be measured directly.

During reactions, the enthalpy of the reactants and the products is not the same. This results in energy being either given out or taken in during the reaction. This energy is the enthalpy change, ΔH (delta H)

ΔH is the change of enthalpy with the units of kilojoules per mol (KJ mol$^{-1}$)

## Exothermic Reactions
Examples (NEED TO MEMORISE):
- Combustion
- Respiration
- Neutralization of acids with alkalis
- Reactions of metals with acids
- Displacement reactions

## Endothermic Reactions
Examples (NEED TO MEMORISE):
- Thermal decomposition
- Photosynthesis
- Some types of electrolysis
- Sherbet

## Reversable Reactions

●HCl (aq) + NaOH (aq) → NaCl (aq) + H2O (l) + heat
●CuSO4 (aq) + Zn (s) → Cu (s) + ZnSO4 (aq) + 217 kJ
●CH4 (g) + 2 O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (g);    ΔH = - 890 kJ


## Catalysts
One way of reducing the energy used in a chemical reaction is to use a **catalyst**. Catalysts allow reactions to take place at a faster rate, and often at a lower temperature.

*A catalyst is a chemical substance that increases the rate of a reaction without being consumed in the reaction. This means catalysts can be reused.*

Catalysts never increase the yield - they just produce the same amount quicker.

Common catalysts:
- Platinum (catalytic converters)
- Vanadium oxide (sulfuric acid production)
- Dilute hydrochloric acid (perfume production)
- Iron (Haber process)


### How do catalysts work?
Catalysts work by reducing the activation energy of a reaction. This is the minimum amount of energy needed for particles to react.


Q's:
a) A catalyst is a chemical substance that increases the rate of a reaction without being consumed in the reaction. It can be reused.
b) The reaction would result in bubbles being formed if there was a substance to catch the bubbles.
c) * Add it to fresh hydrogen peroxide to show it will work again.
