# Diseases

Pathogen: A disease causing agent.
Signs: What can be seen.
Symptoms: What the patient feels.

Diseases can be classed in several ways:
- Infectious vs non-infectious
- Contagious vs non-contagious
- Inherited vs non-inherited
- Acute (quickly and short) vs chronic (slowly and long)
- Single factor (single cause) vs multifactorial (many causes)

Many non-infectious diseases develop as a result of the interaction between a person's environment or lifestyle and their genes.

A risk factor is anything that increases the chance of developing a disease.

Risk factors are correlational with a disease, not necessarily causal.

An infectious disease is a disease resulting from infection of a host organism by a pathogen.
