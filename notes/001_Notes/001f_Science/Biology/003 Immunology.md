# Immunology

The immune system is a group of cells, tissues, organs and mechanisms that defend against pathogens and other foreign substances.

An immune response is a complex series of specific and non-specific processes involving a range of cells and chemicals.

**Methods of disease transmission**
| Direct | Indirect | Vectors |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Person to person | Fecal-oral | Insect Bite |
| Droplets | Airborne |  |
|  | Fomites |  |

| External Defence | How it protects against infection |
| --- | --- |
| Skin | An impervious barrier | 
| Ear | Cerumen inhibits bacterial growth |
| Trachea and bronchi | Mucus layer traps micro-organisms |
| Stomach |  |
| Vagina |  |
| Nasal cavity |  |
| Mouth cavity |  |
| Eyes |  |
| Urethra |  |
| Anus |  |


A reflex is an automatic, involuntary response to a stimulus.

The body uses protective reflexes to protect the body from infection. These include:
- **Sneezing** – irritation in the nose causes forceful expulsion of air, carrying the irritant with it.
- **Coughing** – irritation in the bronchi causes forceful expulsion of air from lungs, carrying the irritant up into the nose or mouth.
- **Vomiting** – irritation in the stomach can cause contraction in the abdominal muscles to expel the stomach contents.
- **Diarrhoea** – irritation in the intestines causes contraction intestinal wall muscles to expel bowel contents.


The immune response involves many types of white blood cells, known as leukocytes.

| Type of leukocyte | Sub-class | Overview of function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Granulocytes: | Neutrophils    | First responder but dies quickly |
|               | Eosinophils    |  |
|               | Basophils      | Causes allergic responses|
| Monocytes     | Dendritic Cells|  |
|               | Macrophages    |  |



## Non-specific immune response

**Inflammation** is a response to tissue damage, it reduces the spread of pathogens and helps repair damaged tissue.

**Phagocytosis**: organism that enter the body are attacked by **phagocytes**, which engulf the invading cells, and destroys them.

**Fever** occurs as a response to infection. The body's thermostat is reset to a higher temperature by the **hypothalamus**, the higher temperature can inhibit the growth of some pathogens and can help the immune system fight the disease.

### Inflammation
1. Tissue damage activates mast cells to release histamine and heparin into tissue fluid.
2. Histamine increases blood flow to the area by vasodilation, making capillary walls more permeable. This causes heat, redness and swelling.
3. Heparin prevents clotting in the immediate area, but a clot forms around that area, protecting nearby tissue.
4. Complement proteins and other chemical messengers attract phagocytes (especially neutrophils) to consume pathogens.
5. Dead phagocytes and tissue fluid form pus.
6. New cells are produced by mitosis, and the wound heals.

## Phagocytosis
Macrophages and neutrophils are both phagocytes.
