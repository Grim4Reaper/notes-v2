# Immunology

The immune system is a group of cells, tissues, organs and mechanisms that defend against pathogens and other foreign substances.

An immune response is a complex series of specific and non-specific processes involving a range of cells and chemicals.

A reflex is an automatic, involuntary response to a stimulus.

The body uses protective reflexes to protect the body from infection. These include:
- **Sneezing** – irritation in the nose causes forceful expulsion of air, carrying the irritant with it.
- **Coughing** – irritation in the bronchi causes forceful expulsion of air from lungs, carrying the irritant up into the nose or mouth.
- **Vomiting** – irritation in the stomach can cause contraction in the abdominal muscles to expel the stomach contents.
- **Diarrhoea** – irritation in the intestines causes contraction intestinal wall muscles to expel bowel contents.
