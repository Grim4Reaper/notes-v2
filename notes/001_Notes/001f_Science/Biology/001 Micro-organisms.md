## Revision

Micro-organisms are very small living organisms, which can only be seen under a microscope.

A **pathogen** is a micro-organism that can cause disease.

Pathogens:
- Bacteria
- Viruses
- Fungi
- Protists

Eukaryotes are any organisms consisting of one or more cells that contain DNA in a membrane-bound nucleus, separate from the cytoplasm. Includes: Animals, plants, fungi, protists.
Prokaryotes are any organisms - usually unicellular - whose DNA is suspended freely in the cytoplasm.

## Bacteria

Bacteria can reproduce quickly and compete with host cells for space and nutrition.
Most are relatively harmless and some may even form mutualistic relationships with hosts.

Can cause disease by:
- Damaging host tissues which prevents normal function
- Producing exotoxins while metabolising
- Releasing endotoxins when destroyed
As the toxins retain their destructive capacity beyond bacterial death, they are often the cause of food poisoning.
