## Chain Reactions
When a uranium-235 nucleus undergoes induced fission after collision with a neutron, it breaks up into two smaller nuclei and two neutrons. These are called fission neutrons.
These fission neutrons can go on to cause further fission events, which will produce further neutrons, and so on, causing a chain reaction.

The smallest amount of mass needed to sustain a chain reaction is called a critical mass.

### How are neutrons controlled?
For nuclear fission to start in a nuclear reactor, a uranium-235 atom must absorb a low speed neutron. The reactor's graphite core slows down the released neutrons so the chain reaction can keep going.

Control rods made of boron absorb excess neutrons to prevent chain reactions getting out of control.

## Nuclear Weapons
Nuclear weapons are uncontrolled chain reactions.

**What was Einstein's role in the development of nuclear weapons?**
	Urged the US government to develop nuclear weapons.
	Contributed to understanding the physics behind it

**What was the Manhattan Project?**
	It was the USA's project to develop an atomic bomb during the 1930s and 40s.

**Why did Truman choose to drop atomic bombs?**
	To end the war in the Pacific, justify the monumental cost of the program, as a warning to all current and future enemies.

**How did the cold war lead us to Hydrogen bombs?**
	

**What should we do about nuclear weapons now?**
