## Revision

Micro-organisms are very small living organisms, which can only be seen under a microscope.

A **pathogen** is a micro-organism that can cause disease.

Pathogens:
- Bacteria
- Viruses
- Fungi
- Protists

Eukaryotes are any organisms consisting of one or more cells that contain DNA in a membrane-bound nucleus, separate from the cytoplasm. Includes: Animals, plants, fungi, protists.
Prokaryotes are any organisms - usually unicellular - whose DNA is suspended freely in the cytoplasm.

## Bacteria

Bacteria can reproduce quickly and compete with host cells for space and nutrition.
Most are relatively harmless and some may even form mutualistic relationships with hosts.

Can cause disease by:
- Damaging host tissues which prevents normal function
- Producing exotoxins while metabolising
- Releasing endotoxins when destroyed
As the toxins retain their destructive capacity beyond bacterial death, they are often the cause of food poisoning.

The capsule protects bacteria from viruses, or attack from a host organism's immune system.

Bacterial cells often contain several plasmids - small continuous loops of DNA.
Plasmids are replicated independently of a bacterium's genophore.


## Viruses
Viruses are non-cellular pathogens, they are not living.

They are very simple structures compared to cells - made from nucleic acids and a protein coat, know as a capsid.
The genetic material can be either DNA or RNA, often have an envelope of membrane around the outside.

## Fungi and Protists

Both fungi and protists are eukaryotic organisms.

Protists are unicellular eukaryotes that are not plants, animals, or fungi.
Protists can be unicellular or multicellular.

Fungi are not photosynthetic, and their cell walls are usually made out of chitin rather than cellulose. (E.g. Mould and yeast)

Many fungal diseases are external, causing irritation and inflammation of the skin.
Candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by a yeast called Candida albicans. Candida normally lives on the skin and inside the body.


Protists include:
- Algae
- Protozoa
- Slime moulds


## Parasitism
Parasitism is a close and permanent association between two organisms in which one benefits and the other is harmed.

### Malaria
Malaria is a disease caused by a protozoan parasite. It is transmitted by a vector - the Anopheles mosquitos.
The symptoms of malaria include shivering, fever, sweating, joint pain, vomiting and anaemia.

They typically occur cyclically every two to three days.
