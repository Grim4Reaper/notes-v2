## Antibiotics
Antibiotics are a group of drugs used to treat bacterial infections.
They are effective against prokaryotic cells but generally leave eukaryotic cells unharmed.

Two different types of antibiotic:
- Bactericidal - kill bacterial cells
- Bacteriostatic - slow the growth or reproduction of bacteria
