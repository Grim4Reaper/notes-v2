- Supply is the amount of goods or services that producers are *willing* and *able* to sell at each *price* point at a particular *point in time*

There is a positive relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied of that good.
At higher prices, suppliers are willing to produce more as it means that they can earn more profit.

- Due to a change in non-price factors
- Rightward shift: Increase in supply
- Leftward shift: Decrease in supply

## Non-price factors

#### Technology
