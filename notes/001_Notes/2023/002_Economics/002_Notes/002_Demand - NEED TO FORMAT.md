Demand

-   The quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to buy at each price in a particular point in time.

Law of demand:

-   Inverse relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product demanded due to:

-   Substitution effect - When a product becomes more expensive, consumers substitute to a cheaper good.
-   Income effect - When a product becomes more expensive, it takes up a larger portion of income and then spends less.

A market demand curve is obtained from the horizontal summation of individual demand curves.
