# Demand

-   The quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to buy at each price in a particular point in time.

### Law of demand

-   Inverse relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product demanded due to:

-   **Substitution** effect - When a product becomes more expensive, consumers substitute to a cheaper good.
-   **Income effect** - When a product becomes more expensive, it takes up a larger portion of income and then spends less.

A market demand curve is obtained from the horizontal summation of individual demand curves.

## Changes in demand

#### Movement
-   A movement along the existing demand curve
-   Due to changes in price
-   Expansion - decrease in price
-   Contraction - increase in price

#### Shift
-   The quantity demanded of the changes at every price
-   Due to change in non-price factors
-   Rightward shift - increase in demand
-   Leftward shift - decrease in demand

### Non price factors (TEPID)

-   Tastes and preferences
-   Price of related goods
-   Substitutes
-   Complements
-   Level of disposable income
-   Normal goods - as income increases, demand increases
-   Inferior - as income increases, demand decrease
-   Demographic factors
-   Age, gender, socioeconomic status
-   Expectations of consumers
-   Consumers may decrease consumption if they are expecting prices to fall

Factors that would increase demand:
-   Price of movie tickets increase, increase demand for streaming services - substitute

Factors that would decrease demand:
-   Increase in the price of phones, decrease in demand for phone cases - complement goods

# Supply

#### Definition
- Supply is the amount of goods or services that producers are *willing* and *able* to sell at each *price* point at a particular *point in time*

There is a positive relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied of that good.
At higher prices, suppliers are willing to produce more as it means that they can earn more profit.

##### Market supply curve
- The curve obtained from the horizontal summation of individual supply curves

#### Movement
	- A movement along the existing supply curve
- Due to changes in the *price* of the good
- *Expansion* in Supply: *Increase* in price
- *Contraction* of Supply: *Decrease* in price

#### Shift:
	- The quantity suppied of the good changes at every price
- Due to a change in *non-price* factors
- *Rightward* shift: *Increase* in supply
- *Leftward* shift: *Decrease* in supply

## Non-price factors

#### Expectations of future prices
- Expected price changes cause suppliers to alter current supply to take advantage of future prices

#### Technology
- Improvement in technology can reduce production cost, allowing suppliers to produce more at a lower cost
- Increase in supply is shown as a rightward shift of the supply curve

#### Prices of other goods
- If the price of a related good increases, the supplier can shift production to increase the quantity supplied of the related good

#### Input prices (Production costs)
- If input prices go down, supply can increase
- If input prices go up, supply decreases

#### Government regulation
- Government regulations influence the number of suppliers in the market, which increases or decreases market supply
- Government regulations can take the form of taxes, tariffs, subsidies and quotas


# Demand and Supply

### Equilibrium
	-The state of the market where there is no tendency for either demand or supply to change

**Equilibrium price** is the price that clears the market, where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.

### Price Mechanism
- The process by which the forces of demand and supply interact to determine the price of a good or service

#### Invisible Hand
	-Aka Price Mechanism

#### Shortage
- When the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied.
- Consumers bid among themselves for the limited goods so the price of the good increase.
- **$Q_d > Q_s$**

#### Surplus
- When the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded
- Firms lower their prices to clear their excess stock
- **$Q_s > Q_d$**
