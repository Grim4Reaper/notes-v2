A CD manufacturing company charges Multimedia companies $6.50 per CD if they create less than 1000 copies. If the company requires more than 10000, they only pay $5.00 a copy. Otherwise, they pay $5.70 a copy. Write a program that will allow the company to calculate how much to charge for different jobs they do. Use the extended If..Then..Else statement.

```Pseudocode
BEGIN
INIT copies AS INTEGER
INPUT(copies)





END
```
