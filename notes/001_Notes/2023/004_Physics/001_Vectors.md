## Vectors
- A vector is a quantity with both **magnitude** and **direction**.

### Horizontal
There are two ways to describe horizontal vectors:
- Full circle/True bearing
- Quadrant bearing

##### True Bearing (TB)
- North is at 0$\degree$ true
- All directions are given as clockwise from north

##### Quadrant Bearing (QB)
- Angles are referenced from either north or south
- Angles are $0\degree\le x \le 90 \degree$ to East or West

### Vertical
- Vectors are referenced to the vertical
- Vectors are $0\degree\le x \le 90 \degree$
